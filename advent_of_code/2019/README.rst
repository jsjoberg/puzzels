===================
Advent of Code 2019
===================

Run ``make`` to build all programs. Run ``make test`` to run programs with the
provided input and example data. The result will be validated against pre
observed results. The test are run in parallel and the result list will be in
the order of program termination.

Each solution has its own source file named with a two digit number of the day
followed by a letter indicating the part. For example Day 9 part 2 is
``09b.cc``. To build a single program run ``make 09b`` etc.

Code is in C++17. Tested with GCC on Linux.
